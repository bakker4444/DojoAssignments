### Assignment details

Create a small node server capable of handling the following **request URLs**:

* `localhost:6789/`    This route should serve a view file called index.html and display a greeting.
* `localhost:6789/ninjas`    This route should serve a view file called ninjas.html and display information about ninjas.
* `localhost:6789/dojos/new`    This route should serve a view file called dojos.html and have a form (don't worry about where the form should be sent to).


If the URL is anything other than the ones above, have an error page load saying that the URL requested is not available.
